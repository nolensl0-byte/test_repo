# Markdown

Markdown is a way to make fancy documents.
Make sure you "Knit" often -- after every major change -- to mitigate errors.
Hashtags are how we make section levels of a doc.

## Next level
### Next level
#### Forth level
##### Fifth level

# Basic formating

This is **bold.** (that's double asterisks). Or *italics*. or `code`

- this is the start of a list. 
- next item. 
- next item. make sure to have space at the end of item

1. this is a numbered list. 
2. second item. 

to add a hyperlink, do `[link text](url)` without backticks.
For example, [go here](https://www.sewanee.edu)

To link to sections of your document, do `[link text](#section-name)`, 
without backticks. For example, [go here](#next-level).

To add more vertical space between blocks of text, use this: "&nbsp,"
without quotes.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Should be more space now.

**To include an image -- fun!**
first put an image inside the folder where your `Rmd` file is located.
Then type `![](full_image_filename_here){width = 50%}`

![](IMG_0439.jpg){width="50%"} 


# RMarkdown

`RMarkdown` is just `Markdown` with `R` code woven in.

You can R stuff in the same line as text. For example, `r 3+3` will show as 6. 
(It will look like backtick lower-case-r space then back code then backtick). 

You can also do a full-multi-line CHUNK of R stuff:

```{r chunck-name }
#```{r}
3+3
#```
```

Settings to control how R chuncks appear:

- `eval = TRUE`: which actually runs the code; if `FALSE`, it shows the code but
doesn't run it.
- `echo = TRUE`: which shows the code; if `FALSE`, the code can run without 
being seen. 

-`warnings = FALSE`: which will turn off warning. 

-`fig.cap = "figure caption"` adds a figure cation. 

-`fig.width = 7` example of width. 

-`fig.height = 4` example of figure width. 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
#this will be shown but not evaluated
3+3
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#this will be evaluated but not shown
4+4
```

# Bringing in real data

To manually set working directory while building up my Rmakedown file, 
just go to Session > Set working directory > Source file loction.

```{r read data, }
library(readr)
energy <- read_csv("IRENA data.csv", skip=1)

```


```{r explore data, }
library(dplyr)
energy %>% names
energy %>% head
energy %>% tail
energy %>% pull(Technology) %>% unique %>% sort
```
